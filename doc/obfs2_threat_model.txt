threat model:

       Adversary capabilities:

The adversary controls the infrastructure of the network within her
jurisdiction, and she can potentially monitor, block, alter, and
inject trafﬁc anywhere within this region.

The censor also holds a blacklist of network protocols, which she is
interested in blocking.

      Adversary attacks:

The censor passively monitors traffic and looks for content
signatures, in an attempt to distinguish network protocols. Upon
detecting a blacklisted protocol, the censor blocks the connection.

     Goals of obfs2:

obfs2 attempts to counter the above attack by removing content
signatures from network traffic. obfs2 encrypts the traffic stream
with a stream cipher, which results in the traffic looking uniformly
random.

     Discussion:

obfs2 shortcomings:

obfs2 was designed as a pluggable transports proof-of-concept: it is
simple, useable and easily implementable. It does _not_ try to protect
against sophisticated adversaries:

obfs2 does not try to protect against Tor protocol fingerprints, like
the packet size or packet timing.

obfs2 does not try to protect against attackers capable of measuring
traffic entropy.

obfs2 does not try to protect against Deep Packet Inspection machines
that expect the obfs2 protocol. Such machines can trivially retrieve
the decryption key off the traffic stream and use it to decrypt obfs2
and detect the Tor protocol.

In other words, obfs2 does not try to protect against anything other
than fingerprintable TLS content patterns.

That said, obfs2 is not useless. It protects against many real-life
Tor traffic detection methods currentl deployed, since most of them
use static SSL handshake strings as signatures.
