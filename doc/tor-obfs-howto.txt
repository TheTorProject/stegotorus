How to set up Tor with Obfsproxy
================================

        Preliminaries:

This isn't the final interface--we should make it much easier.

This is experimental code--if it breaks, you get to keep both smouldering
pieces.



        Ingredients: 

Client side needs:

* a copy of obfsproxy:
  git clone git://git.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
  Building it should be easy, just do "./configure && make".

* a copy of Tor that supports the Socks5Proxy option.
  The git version should do the trick.

Bridge side needs:

* a copy of obfsproxy:
  git clone git://git.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
  Building it should be easy, just do "./configure && make".

* a copy of Tor with BridgeRelay capabilities.
  Quite easy to find nowadays.

        Port setup:

Our port setup will be like this:

              1050                       1051
          +-----------+             +------------+
      ----|   Proxy   |-------------|   Server   |----
      |   +-----------+             +------------+   |
      |                                              |
+------------+                                +--------------+
| Tor Client |                                |  Tor Bridge  |
+------------+                                +--------------+
    5000                                            5001



        Setting up obfsproxies:

This command will setup an obfsproxy socks client listening to the
obfs2 protocol on localhost:1050:
./obfsproxy socks obfs2 127.0.0.1:1050

This command will setup an obfsproxy server listening to the
obfs2 protocol on localhost:5001:
./obfsproxy server obfs2 127.0.0.1:1051 127.0.0.1:5001

        Setting up Tor:

Let's create .torrc_client and .torrc_bridge.
Warning: I'm only posting the relevant torrc options. 

torrc_client:
---
SocksPort 5000 
UseBridges 1
Bridge <bridge host>:1051 # This points to the bridge's obfsproxy server.
                          # You can change <bridge host> to 127.0.0.1
                          # for local testing setup.
Socks5Proxy 127.0.0.1:1050 # This points to our obfsproxy client.
---

torrc_bridge:
---
ORPort 5001 # Port where bridge will be listening on.
BridgeRelay 1
ExitPolicy reject *:*
---

        Bootstrap sequence:

Since we are still in PoC state you have to bootstrap the Tors and the
obfsproxies with the correct sequence:

1. Fire up server obfsproxy.
2. Fire up tor with torrc_bridge.
3. Fire up client obfsproxy.
4. Fire up tor with torrc_client.

        The End

Now open Firefox on the client side and set it up to use a Socks
server on 127.0.0.1:5000.
Stuff should work now.

If you were smart enough to open wireshark and sniff the traffic
before doing all the above, you would notice that the TLS handshake
was not carried out plaintext, effectively obfuscating your Tor
experience. Yes.
