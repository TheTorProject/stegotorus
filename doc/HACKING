         DIY pluggable transports

Everything starts from protocol.c:set_up_protocol(), that's where your
protocol's init function is called.

Init function:
     Your protocol's init function must parse the cli protocol line [1] and
     fill the protocol_params_t struct appropriately. It should also do
     anything else you want to do only once for the runtime of your
     protocol [2]. Finally and most importantly each protocol has a
     function table and your init function should populate it.

obfsproxy currently provides the following functions for protocols
(protocol.h:protocol_vtable):
          (*create): Where you fill the protocol_params_t struct and
                     create a protocol state if you feel like it.
                     Called for every connection.
          (*destroy): Where you free the protocol state and anything
                      else you might have created.
                      Called for every connection.
          (*handshake): Where you send a handshake message to the
                        other party. 
                        Called right after the listener is created 
                        and the necessary network stuff are set up.
          (*send): Where you specify how the data is send according to
                   your protocol.
          (*recv): Where you specify how the data is received
                   according to your protocol.
Note that (*handshake) and (*destroy) are optional.

[1]: For example:
     'your_protocol --additional-parameter=yes server 127.0.0.1:666'
[2]: For example setting up the crypto subsystem. You shouldn't be
     doing this for every connection, just once is enough.
