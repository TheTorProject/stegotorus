> Fit the First
> THE LANDING

> "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
> As he landed his crew with care;
> Supporting each man on the top of the tide
> By a finger entwined in his hair.

< "Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
< That alone should encourage the crew.
< Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
< What I tell you three times is true."

> The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
> A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
> A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
> And a Broker, to value their goods.

< A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
< Might perhaps have won more than his share--
< But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
< Had the whole of their cash in his care.

> There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
> Or would sit making lace in the bow:
> And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
> Though none of the sailors knew how.

< There was one who was famed for the number of things
< He forgot when he entered the ship:
< His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
< And the clothes he had bought for the trip.

> He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
> With his name painted clearly on each:
> But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
> They were all left behind on the beach.

< The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
< He had seven coats on when he came,
< With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,
< He had wholly forgotten his name.

> He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,
> Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"
> To "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"
> But especially "Thing-um-a-jig!"

< While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
< He had different names from these:
< His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"
< And his enemies "Toasted-cheese."

> "His form is ungainly--his intellect small--"
> (So the Bellman would often remark)
> "But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,
> Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."

< He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare
< With an impudent wag of the head:
< And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
< "Just to keep up its spirits," he said.

> He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
> And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
> He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,
> No materials were to be had.

< The last of the crew needs especial remark,
< Though he looked an incredible dunce:
< He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"
< The good Bellman engaged him at once.

> He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
> When the ship had been sailing a week,
> He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
> And was almost too frightened to speak:

< But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
< There was only one Beaver on board;
< And that was a tame one he had of his own,
< Whose death would be deeply deplored.

> The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
> Protested, with tears in its eyes,
> That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
> Could atone for that dismal surprise!

< It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
< Conveyed in a separate ship:
< But the Bellman declared that would never agree
< With the plans he had made for the trip:

> Navigation was always a difficult art,
> Though with only one ship and one bell:
> And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
> Undertaking another as well.

< The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
< A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
< So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure
< Its life in some Office of note:

> This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
> (On moderate terms), or for sale,
> Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
> And one Against Damage From Hail.

< Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
< Whenever the Butcher was by,
< The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
< And appeared unaccountably shy.


> Fit the Second
> THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH

> The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
> Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
> Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
> The moment one looked in his face!

> He had bought a large map representing the sea,
> Without the least vestige of land:
> And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
> A map they could all understand.

< "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
< Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"
< So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
< "They are merely conventional signs!

< "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
< But we've got our brave Captain to thank:"
< (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best--
< A perfect and absolute blank!"

> This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out
> That the Captain they trusted so well
> Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
> And that was to tingle his bell.

> He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
> Were enough to bewilder a crew.
> When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"
> What on earth was the helmsman to do?

< Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
< A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
< That frequently happens in tropical climes,
< When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked."

< But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
< And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
< Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
< That the ship would not travel due West!

> But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
> With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
> Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
> Which consisted of chasms and crags.

> The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
> And repeated in musical tone
> Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
> But the crew would do nothing but groan.

< He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
< And bade them sit down on the beach:
< And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
< As he stood and delivered his speech.

< "Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"
< (They were all of them fond of quotations:
< So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,
< While he served out additional rations).

> "We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
> (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
> But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
> Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!

> "We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
> (Seven days to the week I allow),
> But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
> We have never beheld till now!

< "Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
< The five unmistakable marks
< By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
< The warranted genuine Snarks.

< "Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,
< Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:
< Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
< With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp.

> "Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
> That it carries too far, when I say
> That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,
> And dines on the following day.

> "The third is its slowness in taking a jest.
> Should you happen to venture on one,
> It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
> And it always looks grave at a pun.

< "The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
< Which is constantly carries about,
< And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
< A sentiment open to doubt.

< "The fifth is ambition. It next will be right
< To describe each particular batch:
< Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
< And those that have whiskers, and scratch.

> "For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
> Yet, I feel it my duty to say,
> Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm,
> For the Baker had fainted away.


> Fit the Third
> THE BAKER'S TALE

> They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--
> They roused him with mustard and cress--
> They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
> They set him conundrums to guess.

> When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
> His sad story he offered to tell;
> And the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a shriek!"
> And excitedly tingled his bell.

> There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,
> Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
> As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe
> In an antediluvian tone.

< "My father and mother were honest, though poor--"
< "Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.
< "If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--
< We have hardly a minute to waste!"

< "I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,
< "And proceed without further remark
< To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
< To help you in hunting the Snark.

< "A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
< Remarked, when I bade him farewell--"
< "Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,
< As he angrily tingled his bell.

> "He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,
> "'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
> Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,
> And it's handy for striking a light.

> "'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;
> You may hunt it with forks and hope;
> You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
> You may charm it with smiles and soap--'"

> ("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold
> In a hasty parenthesis cried,
> "That's exactly the way I have always been told
> That the capture of Snarks should be tried!")

< "'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
< If your Snark be a Boojum! For then
< You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
< And never be met with again!'

< "It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
< When I think of my uncle's last words:
< And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
< Brimming over with quivering curds!

< "It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before!"
< The Bellman indignantly said.
< And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.
< It is this, it is this that I dread!

> "I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--
> In a dreamy delirious fight:
> I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
> And I use it for striking a light:

< "But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
< In a moment (of this I am sure),
< I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--
< And the notion I cannot endure!"


> Fit the fourth
> THE HUNTING

> The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.
> "If only you'd spoken before!
> It's excessively awkward to mention it now,
> With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!

> "We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,
> If you never were met with again--
> But surely, my man, when the voyage began,
> You might have suggested it then?

> "It's excessively awkward to mention it now--
> As I think I've already remarked."
> And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,
> "I informed you the day we embarked.

> "You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--
> (We are all of us weak at times):
> But the slightest approach to a false pretence
> Was never among my crimes!

< "I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--
< I said it in German and Greek:
< But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)
< That English is what you speak!"

< "'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face
< Had grown longer at every word:
< "But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,
< More debate would be simply absurd.

< "The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)
< "You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.
< But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!
< 'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!

< "To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;
< To pursue it with forks and hope;
< To threaten its life with a railway-share;
< To charm it with smiles and soap!

> "For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't
> Be caught in a commonplace way.
> Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:
> Not a chance must be wasted to-day!

> "For England expects--I forbear to proceed:
> 'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:
> And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need
> To rig yourselves out for the fight."

> Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),
> And changed his loose silver for notes.
> The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,
> And shook the dust out of his coats.

> The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--
> Each working the grindstone in turn:
> But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
> No interest in the concern:

< Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
< And vainly proceeded to cite
< A number of cases, in which making laces
< Had been proved an infringement of right.

< The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned
< A novel arrangement of bows:
< While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand
< Was chalking the tip of his nose.

< But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,
< With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--
< Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,
< Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff."

< "Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he said,
< "If we happen to meet it together!"
< And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,
< Said "That must depend on the weather."

> The Beaver went simply galumphing about,
> At seeing the Butcher so shy:
> And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,
> Made an effort to wink with one eye.

< "Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard
< The Butcher beginning to sob.
< "Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,
< We shall need all our strength for the job!"


> Fit the Fifth
< THE BEAVER'S LESSON

> They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
< They pursued it with forks and hope;
> They threatened its life with a railway-share;
< They charmed it with smiles and soap.

> Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
< For making a separate sally;
> And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
< A dismal and desolate valley.

> But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
< It had chosen the very same place:
> Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
< The disgust that appeared in his face.

> Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"
< And the glorious work of the day;
> And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
< That the other was going that way.

> But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
< And the evening got darker and colder,
> Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)
< They marched along shoulder to shoulder.

> Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
< And they knew that some danger was near:
> The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
< And even the Butcher felt queer.

> He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
< That blissful and innocent state--
> The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
< A pencil that squeaks on a slate!

> "'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.
< (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")
> "As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,
< "I have uttered that sentiment once.

> "'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;
< You will find I have told it you twice.
> 'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,
< If only I've stated it thrice."

> The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
< Attending to every word:
> But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
< When the third repetition occurred.

> It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
< It had somehow contrived to lose count,
> And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
< By reckoning up the amount.

> "Two added to one--if that could but be done,"
< It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs!"
> Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
< It had taken no pains with its sums.

> "The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.
< The thing must be done, I am sure.
> The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,
< The best there is time to procure."

> The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,
< And ink in unfailing supplies:
> While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
< And watched them with wondering eyes.

> So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
< As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
> And explained all the while in a popular style
< Which the Beaver could well understand.

> "Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
< A convenient number to state--
> We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
< By One Thousand diminished by Eight.

> "The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
< By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:
> Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
< Exactly and perfectly true.

> "The method employed I would gladly explain,
< While I have it so clear in my head,
> If I had but the time and you had but the brain--
< But much yet remains to be said.

> "In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
< Enveloped in absolute mystery,
> And without extra charge I will give you at large
< A Lesson in Natural History."

> In his genial way he proceeded to say
< (Forgetting all laws of propriety,
> And that giving instruction, without introduction,
< Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

> "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
< Since it lives in perpetual passion:
> Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
< It is ages ahead of the fashion:

> "But it knows any friend it has met once before:
< It never will look at a bribe:
> And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
< And collects--though it does not subscribe.

> "Its' flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
< Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
> (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
< And some, in mahogany kegs:)

> "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
< You condense it with locusts and tape:
> Still keeping one principal object in view--
< To preserve its symmetrical shape."

> The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
< But he felt that the lesson must end,
> And he wept with delight in attempting to say
< He considered the Beaver his friend.

> While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
< More eloquent even than tears,
> It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
< Would have taught it in seventy years.

> They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
< (For a moment) with noble emotion,
> Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days
< We have spent on the billowy ocean!"

> Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
< Have seldom if ever been known;
> In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
< You could never meet either alone.

> And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds
< Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--
> The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
< And cemented their friendship for ever!


> Fit the Sixth
> THE BARRISTER'S DREAM

< They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
< They pursued it with forks and hope;
> They threatened its life with a railway-share;
> They charmed it with smiles and soap.

< But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
< That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
> Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
> That his fancy had dwelt on so long.

< He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
< Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
> Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
> On the charge of deserting its sty.

< The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
< That the sty was deserted when found:
> And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
> In a soft under-current of sound.

< The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
< And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
> And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
> What the pig was supposed to have done.

< The Jury had each formed a different view
< (Long before the indictment was read),
> And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
> One word that the others had said.

< "You must know--" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"
< That statute is obsolete quite!
> Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
> On an ancient manorial right.

< "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
< To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
> While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
> If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'

< "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;
< But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
> (So far as related to the costs of this suit)
> By the Alibi which has been proved.

< "My poor client's fate now depends on your votes."
< Here the speaker sat down in his place,
> And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
> And briefly to sum up the case.

< But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
< So the Snark undertook it instead,
> And summed it so well that it came to far more
> Than the Witnesses ever had said!

< When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
< As the word was so puzzling to spell;
> But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
> Undertaking that duty as well.

< So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
< It was spent with the toils of the day:
> When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned,
> And some of them fainted away.

< Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
< Too nervous to utter a word:
> When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
> And the fall of a pin might be heard.

< "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,
< "And then to be fined forty pound."
> The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
> That the phrase was not legally sound.

< But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
< When the jailer informed them, with tears,
> Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
> As the pig had been dead for some years.

< The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
< But the Snark, though a little aghast,
> As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,
> Went bellowing on to the last.

< Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
< To grow every moment more clear:
> Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
> Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.


> Fit the Seventh
> THE BANKER'S FATE

> They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
< They pursued it with forks and hope;
< They threatened its life with a railway-share;
< They charmed it with smiles and soap.

> And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
< It was matter for general remark,
< Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
< In his zeal to discover the Snark

> But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
< A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
< And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
< For he knew it was useless to fly.

> He offered large discount--he offered a cheque
< (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
< But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
< And grabbed at the Banker again.

> Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
< Went savagely snapping around--
< He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
< Till fainting he fell to the ground.

> The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
< Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
< And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"
< And solemnly tolled on his bell.

> He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
< The least likeness to what he had been:
< While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--
< A wonderful thing to be seen!

> To the horror of all who were present that day.
< He uprose in full evening dress,
< And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
< What his tongue could no longer express.

> Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--
< And chanted in mimsiest tones
< Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
< While he rattled a couple of bones.

> "Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!"
< The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
< "We have lost half the day. Any further delay,
< And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!"


> Fit the Eighth
> THE VANISHING

< They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
> They pursued it with forks and hope;
> They threatened its life with a railway-share;
> They charmed it with smiles and soap.

< They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,
> And the Beaver, excited at last,
> Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,
> For the daylight was nearly past.

< "There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said,
> "He is shouting like mad, only hark!
> He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
> He has certainly found a Snark!"

< They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed
> "He was always a desperate wag!"
> They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--
> On the top of a neighboring crag.

< Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.
> In the next, that wild figure they saw
> (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,
> While they waited and listened in awe.

< "It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,
> And seemed almost too good to be true.
> Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
> Then the ominous words "It's a Boo-"

< Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air
> A weary and wandering sigh
> Then sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare
> It was only a breeze that went by.

> They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
< Not a button, or feather, or mark,
< By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
< Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

> In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
< In the midst of his laughter and glee,
< He had softly and suddenly vanished away--
< For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.

> THE END
