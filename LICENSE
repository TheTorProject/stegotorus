Some files in src/ contain material which is copyright other people
or organizations, and which may be licensed more permissively than the
above.  Comments at the top of each file document its precise provenance
and licensing.

All the files in config-aux/ and scripts/ have their own copyright and
licensing, indicated in comments at the top of the file; these licenses
may be more or *less* permissive than the above.  Those licenses DO NOT
extend to the collective work, the generated configure script, or to
StegoTorus itself.
